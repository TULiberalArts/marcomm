## Our Research is Driving Science Forward and Changing the World
Research in the College of Liberal Arts spans the humanities, arts, social sciences and STEM fields. In _geography_, a new spatial analytics lab provides tools that allow researchers to inform policy in key areas such as health¬care by mapping disease and highlighting geographic health disparities.  Other faculty investigate the social, economic and political impact of the diffusion of new information tech¬nologies in the U.S. and across the world. They probe the depths of higher education funding and marry computer science and literature through the _digital humanities_. Our _philosophy_ faculty does cutting-edge research in the area of biomedical ethics, changing the way we understand the relationship between medicine and our values. Our _religion_ professors write award-winning books that bring new understandings of racial dynamics in American religious history.

Members of our _psychology_ faculty, one of the finest in the country, lead in the study of anxiety disorders, child development and human cognition. Using our new func¬tional MRI research center, they will break new ground in understanding the early impact of trauma on developing brains. Our _political scientists_ study how to promote democracy around the world, while military historians conduct interdisciplinary research on the historic and contemporary use of force and diplomacy in a global context—a timely specialty in today’s world. Temple’s _criminal justice_ scholars pursue smarter ways to man¬age probation, resulting in smaller prison populations and safer communities.  These examples, represent a small fraction of our output.
