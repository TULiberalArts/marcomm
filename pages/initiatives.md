## Diversity and Inclusion Postdoctoral Fellowships
The Diversity and Inclusion Postdoctoral Fellowships in the Liberal Arts support the development of early-career scholars from historically underrepresented groups in the profession. These are one-year positions with a 0-1 teaching load designed to give Diversity and Inclusion scholars time to begin research immediately after completing their PhDs in an intellectually rich and supportive environment.

ACLS is pleased to announce three new partnerships that reflect our commitment to supporting institutional efforts to increase the diversity of college and university faculty. Through this program, **The City College of New York, Haverford College, and Temple University** will each offer a two-year postdoctoral fellowship for promising early career scholars from historically underrepresented groups such as black/African American, American Indian, Alaskan Native, and Hispanic/Latino scholars. The institutions will appoint these fellows with the intent to promote them to Assistant Professor roles at the end of the fellowship period. Support for ACLS’s Postdoctoral Partnership Initiative is made possible by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.

“These three new partnerships each, in their own way, exemplify the innovative, high-quality postdoctoral opportunities that this program was designed to foster,” said ACLS program officer Valerie Popp. “Some plan to target a specific field that the faculty and institution see as a promising environment for more diverse voices, while others hope to create new pathways and processes for hiring faculty across campus. Alongside ACLS, our partners seek to help foster a more broadly representative generation of humanities faculty by recruiting historically underrepresented scholars as postdocs to propel their transition into the professoriate. These experiences also stand to enrich our ongoing conversation about the evolution of the humanities professoriate and the possibilities for programs like these to be transformative for scholars and institutions alike.” 

These partnerships are the result of an open call for proposals ACLS issued in fall 2018 and represent an evolution of an initiative to learn more about the role of postdoctoral fellowships in the humanities and their impact on the scholars who held them. For each partnership, ACLS will cover the cost of one two-year postdoctoral fellowship with a competitive annual stipend and benefits to be hosted within a department at the institution. The call for proposals continues with a rolling deadline.  ACLS looks forward to partnering with additional institutions that envision working intensively with individual departments that seek to utilize the postdoc as a pathway to building faculty body more representative of the diversity of our students and today’s curricular needs.

### 2019-2020 Academic Year Fellows:

<details>
  <summary><strong>Rachel Goffe - Geography and Urban Studies</strong></summary>
<p>Rachel is a human geographer and a licensed architect. Her research focuses on the relationships among the built environment, land rights, and livelihood, questioning how these relationships structure—and are structured by—the racial capitalist state. She has done research in Jamaica, where she is originally from, and in Philadelphia, where she has lived for many years. Through ethnographic research in informal settlements in Jamaica, she investigated the enactment of new policy regarding squatting, explicating how that process was shaped by regional traditions and the engagement of residents with varied aspects of the state—from social welfare to enforcement agencies. In Philadelphia, Dr. Goffe worked with community organizations struggling against dispossession, shrinking public services, and low wages. With residents, she co-produced media, research, education, and GIS analysis to articulate alternative visions for the city. The resulting radio and video pieces aired on community low power radio, community access TV and internet platforms, but most importantly they aided in building relationships with other organizers. Dr. Goffe earned a Bachelor’s in Architecture from Temple University and a Ph.D. from the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.</p>
  
<p>Dr. Goffe is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Human Geography at the University of Toronto-Scarborough.</p>
