## Temple University Graduate School
### First Summer Research Initiative 
The [First Summers Research Initiative](https://grad.temple.edu/admissions/costs-financial-aid-more/university-financial-support) is a competition for summer research awards for domestic doctoral students at Temple University who are traditionally underrepresented in their fields of study. These awards provide eligible students with funding for the pursuit of research activity in the first, second and/or third summers of their graduate studies. The award is valued at $6,000. Applicants can apply each summer until they achieve candidacy, although preference is given to first-time applicants. The application is due annually in March. Refer to the [Graduate School calendar](https://bulletin.temple.edu/graduate/academic-calendar/) for the specific due date.

### Doctoral Dissertation Completion Grant and Master of Fine Arts Project Completion Grant 
The [Doctoral Dissertation Completion Grant and Master of Fine Arts Project Completion Grant](https://grad.temple.edu/admissions/costs-financial-aid-more/university-financial-support) offers significant financial support to promising students who want to accelerate completion of their degree. Applicants apply for the award as their final term approaches. The award allows students to devote themselves full time to the completion of their dissertation or master’s project.

These grants are awarded once during the fall and spring terms. An application must be submitted by the student and the department. Nominations are due to the Graduate School in October each year for the upcoming spring term and in March for the following fall term. Refer to the [Graduate School calendar](https://bulletin.temple.edu/graduate/academic-calendar/) for specific nomination due dates.
