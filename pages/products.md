If you would like to order products or swag for your department or center the Marketing and Communciations team can support these efforts.

## Before Ordering
Consider your departmental budget when ordering products or swag. Costs of production and delivery can rise quickly and we ask that you consider if the product has a return in drawing new students or building a better relationship with current students. You can also set up a meeting with the Marketing and Communications team to discuss the best avenues for supporting your goals.
