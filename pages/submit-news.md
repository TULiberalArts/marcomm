## College News Stories
[College News](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/news) is our blog-like platform for telling the story of the College of Liberal Arts. Here, we share the narratives of our students, alumni, faculty, staff, programs, etc. Please contact Nick Santangelo (nsantangelo@temple.edu) and Rosemary Fahmie (rosemary.fahmie@temple.edu) in advance of an event, student or faculty award or achievement, new program, or other CLA happening that you feel can further the narrative of the liberal arts and help drive student leads and/or boost the college’s prestige.

## Social Media
CLA’s social platforms are: [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/tuliberalarts/), Twitter, [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/templeliberalarts/), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy_Uzx2MSjPw00noakBuf8g),  and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/school/temple-university-college-of-liberal-arts/). If you wish to create a social media profile for your program or department please reach out to Rosemary Fahmie (rosemary.fahmie@temple.edu) in advance of creation for brand alignment and consultation. This will also ensure that you are included in the Social Media Managers meetings that are held with all active CLA social media managers.
