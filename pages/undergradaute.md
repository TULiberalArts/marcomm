The College of Liberal Arts’ student body is driven by curiosity and questioning. Our undergraduates are helping change the status quo in a variety of disciplines. 

We encourage all our students to participate in research. The College of Liberal Arts offers funding opportunities each semester to afford students to undertake this critical and impactful work. Our Liberal Arts Undergraduate Research Awards (LAURAs) and the Creative Arts and Research Scholarship (CARAs) are the sole providers supporting our undergraduate research. 

## Liberal Arts Undergraduate Research Awards (LAURAs)
The Liberal Arts Undergraduate Research Awards (LAURAs). The LAURAs grant $2,000 each to undergraduate student-faculty member duos to conduct a research project over the course of a semester. Each student earns a $15/hour stipend from the grant while spending 100 hours on the project, which enables students to dedicate their time to developing research skills without having to worry about their financial wellbeing.

The Liberal Arts Undergraduate Research Awards (LAURA) creates more opportunities for undergraduate students to develop research skills by working with faculty mentors on faculty-led research projects while increasing support for faculty research in the College of Liberal Arts.
